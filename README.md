Welcome to the Industrial Human Resource Geo-Visualization project!
This project aims to update and analyze the industrial classification of main and marginal workers in India.

We use techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the workforce distribution across various industries.

The project falls under the domain of Resource Management.

Problem Statement:
In India, understanding the distribution of the labor force across various sectors is essential. However, the current data on the industrial classification of the workforce may be outdated. This project aims to update the information on the industrial classification of main and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, to provide relevant and accurate data for policy making and employment planning.

Approach:
Merge all the provided CSV data files and create a dataframe.
Perform classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing. Utilize Natural Language Processing for analyzing various core industries and grouping business categories like Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, Manufacturing, etc.
Results:
Develop a dashboard app with Streamlit using Plotly to visualize the workers' population across various industries with respect to various geographies. Analyze facts and figures for the business problem.

Dataset:
The dataset contains state-wise counts of industrial classification of main and marginal workers of males and females who work under different sectors like manufacturing plastic products, rubber products, chemicals, furniture, constructions of buildings, retails, etc.

Technologies:
EDA, Visualization, NLP

Domain:
Resource Management
